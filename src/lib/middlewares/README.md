# middlewares

Note that these middlewares are no longer maintained, so have been modified slightly to integrate with this application.

Any mods should be backwards compatible with existing `noflo` graphs and components.

Mods can be compared relative to [this commit](https://github.com/noflo/noflo/commit/6187566f761a463af95dd186de55dc488e2f03b8).
